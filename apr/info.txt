	Terminology Reference: 
	Puzzle Solving 		- To continue, we approach an actor that takes control of our camera to do an arbitrary puzzle. Requires unique item storage.  
	Password Searching 	- Key combinations are randomized each time the level is reset. Their locations (depending on properties) can be randomized.
	Key Hunting 		- Player is given a random findable required to open the exit. Skeleton Hunting and Artifact Hunting are related to this type.
	Countdown Invasion 	- This requires level setup to fit arena layouts. Player encounters an arbitrary mover that needs (countdown) time to open. 
	Gateway Hunting		- Mostly done level-side: player has to reroute a group of warpzones correctly to reach an exit. Maybe by finding an item.
	Island Control 		- Similar to onslaught: In hostile areas - a node scans for living _hate pawns. If none can be found, we are given area control.
	Book Searching		- To finish the map, player is tasked with finding a special translator message (unless the map provides a good substitute).
	Force Field Searching 	- Somewhat similar to Map Control. Requires setup from the editor. Map flow is guided by how player redirects each forcefield.
	Ship Control            - Requires a large map for workspace-related objectives. Also requires a _friendly pawn to interact with, as well as the reward.
	Away Mission Hunting    - Player is given a unique objective, usually related to rescuing a _friendly pawn or finding a key to exit this mission space.
	Pawn Assasination       - Player is tasked with destroying a specific pawn. The circumstances of this goal are randomized every time the map is started.
	Level Maintenance       - To exit the level, player has to find object A and repair it with object B by finding object C, which is obscured by object D.
	Large Map Assault       - Like in Thief, backtracking is required once the map objectives are done. While player is backtracking, exit strategy changes. 
	Vehicle Hunting         - Straightforward at a glance. Iterate for any vehicles in the map then use one as a getaway object. As long as it is intact.  
	Mission Searching       - For any pickup in the level, find one and turn it into goal object. If a scriptedpawn is in the vicinity - have them take it. 
	Map Control             - Involves 
	Linear Sequence         - Straightforward logic with little to no backtracking. Flow usually determined by triggered events or key-related objectives.
