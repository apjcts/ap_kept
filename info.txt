Cleanup Guide                                                                 
-----------------
If you wish to update the packages, make sure to get rid of listed-below files before installing the next version: 

	apcamera.u 
	apr.u 
	april.ini 		<- you'll need to edit the new version to keep your preferences
	april.u 
	april_demo.bat 		<- incase launch settings have been changed by the author (which is VERY likely)
	april_main.bat          <- same deal
	apriluser.ini 		
	APRLANG_aprw_v2.ini 
	aprlc.u 
	aprng.u 
	aprngc.u

Note that ini files are kept read-only to avoid inconsistencies, be sure to switch toggle it back on if you edited the file. 
This is needed to keep some magic numbers afloat during the gameplay process - as it updates the ini file at runtime automatically.
If you mess with inis to the point of no return, you can recompile them by using [dumpint packagename.u] in unreal's ucc commandlet.	

Installation
------------
COPY 	.unr files	to 	Unreal/Maps folder
COPY	.txt files	to 	Unreal/Help folder
COPY	.html files	to 	Unreal/Help folder
COPY	.umx files	to	Unreal/Music folder
COPY	.uax files	to	Unreal/Sounds folder
COPY	.utx files	to	Unreal/Textures folder
COPY	.u files 	to	Unreal/System folder
COPY	.ini files 	to	Unreal/System folder
COPY	.int files 	to	Unreal/System folder

In order for these packages to work, you need a copy of Unreal 
with the OldUnreal Patch installed, you can find the patch here: 
https://github.com/OldUnreal/Unreal-testing/releases/tag/v227k

Build Instructions
------------------

To build the .uc files contained within this repository, you'll need to get rid of virtually every content importing subroutine within. 
While the task is kind of pointless, it would be funny to see someone try it (and fail). I'd suggest decompiling the packages, you can 
get them here: 	(will be added later)

8s,<&}p@Rt+/eScC will open apkept.zip for viewing, it will contain precompiled assets needed for testing.
"Why the password?" you might ask. Well... To make things more complicated. Since the file is hosted on 
archive.org i felt it'd be sensible to lock it behind a sequence of random digits and numbers. It's only 
sensible considering the amount of hoops we have to jump through to access the goods. Any goods, really.
